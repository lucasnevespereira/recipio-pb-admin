# Recipio PocketBase Admin

### Steps I used to deploy to Fly.io
Hosted on [fly.io](https://fly.io/)

```sh
brew install flyctl
```

Create a fly app
````
flyctl auth login
fly launch
````
<small>Choose app name and region and answer no to everything else.</small>

Create a volume for pocket base data
```
fly volumes create pb_data --size=1
```

If you see the following warning:
```text
Warning! Individual volumes are pinned to individual hosts. You should create two or more volumes per application. You will have downtime if you only create one. Learn more at https://fly.io/docs/reference/volumes/
```
Pocket base as an embed sqlite database, it is already in the single binary deployed.
And according to [fly.io volumes docs](https://fly.io/docs/reference/volumes/), this warning does not concern our case
```text
There are exceptions to the rule of running at least two Fly volumes. For example, if you're running an app with a standard SQLite database, or your app is in development and you're not worried about downtime while you deploy it, then you can run a single Machine with an attached volume.
```

Add a mounts field to your `fly.toml` generated by fly cli

```toml
[mounts]
  destination = "/pb/pb_data"
  source= "pb_data"
```


Call ```fly launch``` again and this time answer `yes` to deploy
